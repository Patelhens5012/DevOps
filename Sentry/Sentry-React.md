### Step 1: Create a React App

1. Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed on your system.

2. Open your terminal and create a new React app using Create React App:
   ```bash
   npx create-react-app sentry-demo
   ```

3. Navigate into your new project directory:
   ```bash
   cd sentry-demo
   ```

### Step 2: Install Sentry SDK

1. Install Sentry SDK for JavaScript:
   ```bash
   npm install @sentry/react @sentry/tracing
   ```

### Step 3: Create a Simple React Component

1. Open `src/App.js` in your code editor.

2. Replace the contents with the following code:
   ```javascript
   import React from 'react';

   function App() {
     const handleClick = () => {
       // Intentionally causing an error
       throw new Error('This is a test error');
     };

     return (
       <div>
         <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
         <button onClick={handleClick}>Click me to throw an error</button>
       </div>
     );
   }

   export default App;
   ```

### Step 4: Initialize Sentry in your React App

1. Open `src/index.js`.

2. Import Sentry and initialize it with your DSN (Data Source Name) obtained from the Sentry dashboard:
   ```javascript
   import React from 'react';
   import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
   import { Integrations } from '@sentry/tracing';
   import { App } from './App';
   import * as Sentry from '@sentry/react';

   Sentry.init({
     dsn: 'YOUR_SENTRY_DSN',
     integrations: [
       new Integrations.BrowserTracing(),
     ],
     tracesSampleRate: 1.0,
   });

   ReactDOM.render(
     <React.StrictMode>
       <App />
     </React.StrictMode>,
     document.getElementById('root')
   );
   ```

Replace `'YOUR_SENTRY_DSN'` with the actual DSN provided by Sentry.

### Step 5: Test the Application

1. Run the React app:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

2. Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:3000`.

3. Click the button to trigger the error.

### Step 6: View Errors in Sentry Dashboard

1. Go to your Sentry dashboard and navigate to your project.

2. You should see the error you triggered in the dashboard.

By following these steps, you've created a simple React "Hello, World!" application and integrated Sentry for error tracking. You can now monitor and track errors that occur in your React app to improve its stability and performance.
