### Step 1: Create a Python Application

1. Open your terminal.

2. Create a new directory for your Python project:
   ```bash
   mkdir sentry_demo_python
   ```

3. Navigate into the directory:
   ```bash
   cd sentry_demo_python
   ```

4. Create a new Python file, for example, `app.py`:
   ```bash
   touch app.py
   ```

### Step 2: Install Sentry SDK

1. Install the Sentry SDK for Python using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install sentry-sdk
   ```

### Step 3: Configure Sentry in Your Python Application

1. Open `app.py` in a text editor.

2. Import Sentry and initialize it with your DSN (Data Source Name) obtained from the Sentry dashboard:
   ```python
   import sentry_sdk
   from sentry_sdk.integrations.flask import FlaskIntegration

   sentry_sdk.init(
       dsn="YOUR_SENTRY_DSN",
       integrations=[FlaskIntegration()]
   )
   ```

Replace `'YOUR_SENTRY_DSN'` with the actual DSN provided by Sentry.

3. Define a simple function to generate an error:
   ```python
   def generate_error():
       division_by_zero = 1 / 0
   ```

### Step 4: Test the Application

1. Create a Flask route to trigger the error. Update `app.py`:
   ```python
   from flask import Flask

   app = Flask(__name__)

   @app.route('/')
   def hello():
       generate_error()  # This will trigger an error
       return 'Hello, World!'

   if __name__ == '__main__':
       app.run(debug=True)
   ```

### Step 5: Run the Application

1. Run your Flask application:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

2. Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:5000`.

3. You should see an error message on the webpage.

### Step 6: View Errors in Sentry Dashboard

1. Go to your Sentry dashboard and navigate to your project.

2. You should see the error you triggered in the dashboard.

By following these steps, you've created a simple Python application using Flask and integrated Sentry for error tracking. You can now monitor and track errors that occur in your Python app to improve its stability and performance.
