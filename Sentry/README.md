## Install Docker and Docker Compose
1. Download and add the Docker GPG key:
```bash
curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/docker-archive-keyring.gpg
```
2. Add the Docker repository:
```bash
echo "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/docker-archive-keyring.gpg] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu $(lsb_release -cs) stable" | tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null
```
3. Update the repository cache:
```bash
apt update -y
```
4. Install Docker and Docker Compose:
```bash
apt install docker docker-compose -y
```
5. Start and enable Docker:
```bash
systemctl start docker
systemctl enable docker
```
6. Verify Docker status:
```bash
systemctl status docker
```
7. Check Docker version:

## Install Sentry
1. Clone the Sentry repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/getsentry/onpremise
```
2. Change directory to the downloaded repository and run the installation script:

## Launch Sentry Container
1. Start the Sentry container:
